To run the demos, you will need npm and grunt. Also, you may need to create a
symlink of the directory src/proto in the root directory of this project. Then,
you may run the tests and demos like so::

    node moveJointsTest.js

To run the browser demo, start a simple webserver in the root directory of the
project::

    python3 -m http.server
